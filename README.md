Description:
We propose a novel wheezing sound detection approach combining a recursive orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (ONMF) and the Gini index spectral sparsity. This recursive approach is composed of four stages. The first stage is based on the ONMF model to factorize the spectral bases as dissimilar as possible. The second stage attempts to cluster the ONMF spectral bases into two categories: wheezing and normal breath. The third stage defines the stop criterion of the recursive method that avoids the loss of wheezing spectral content. Finally, the fourth stage determines the patient's condition in order to locate the temporal intervals in which wheeze sounds are active for unhealthy patients.

Note that in the case of a healthy patient, the algorithm returns a message with the following information "healthy patient" and a spectrogram to visualize the signal in the time-frequency domain. However, in the case of an unhealthy patient the algorithm returns a message with the following information 'unhealthy patient' and a figure divided into three subfigures: (i) the figure at the top shows the spectrogram of the original signal; (ii) the figure in the middle shows the estimated wheezing spectrogram in the optimal recursive iteration; and (iii) the figure at the bottom shows the time intervals in which the wheezing is active. 

The main file to be run has been denoted as "Main_ESWA.m".
The function denoted as "sg.m" allows to obtain the spectrogram of a signal and has been obtained directly from the following link "dddd". 
The function denoted as "nmf_no" allows to obtain the basis and activation matrix of the orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization approach and has been obtained directly from the following link "https://github.com/iwonasob/nmflib/blob/master/nmf_kl_loc.m".
